# Network-Intrusion-Detection
Network Intrusion Detection system predicts unauthorized use or attacking a computer or telecommunications network. To prevent confidential data from getting in the hands of an attacker. This Repository performs NID using KDD cup dataset. In this repo 
a sparsse autoencoder is used to reduce the number of features then two algorithms are used to perform prediction Random Forest and XGBoost.
